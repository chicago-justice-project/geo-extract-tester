    <br>

    The format is simple. Distinct words are newline separated, and documents are
    separated by two newlines.
    <br>
    <br>

    You need to upload a file with the same number of lines,
    where each line is a number between 0 and 1 inclusive representing the probability
    that word contains location information. Where the original file contains empty lines,
    your uploaded file should <em>not</em> contain a guess (either skip the line altogether,
    or put an empty line in your uploaded file).
    <br>
    <br>

    Below is a short example python script to load the data and make random guesses.

    <br>

<pre>
with open('validation.txt', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    s = f.read()

import random
def guess(word):
    if word:
        return str(random.random())
    else:
        return '' # do not guess on empty lines!

with open('guesses.txt', 'w') as f:
    for line in s.split('\n'):
        f.write(guess(line) + '\n')
</pre>
</div>

<div>
    <form action="/score" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
        Upload file to score:
        <input type="file" name="file" id="file">

        <br>
        Your name: <input type="text" name="name" id="name">
        <br>
        <br>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
